This website is being hosted on https://memories-2021.netlify.app/


Setup:

You can run the client locally with this command:

run npm i && npm start
It will call this api hosted on heroku: https://memories-posts-2021.herokuapp.com/posts


If you want to set up the server alone you will need to set up your loacal variables (please see server/.env.example) and your own instance of MongoDB.


To set up both the client and server:
run npm i && npm start for both client and server side to start the app
